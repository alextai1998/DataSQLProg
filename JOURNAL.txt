Today we used the poke-centres we created last class and we extracted independent tables from the Unique Centralised Database. We then tried to describe the relationship between the tables and identified the schemas and the key attributes, also known as primary keys. We learned that a database represents some aspect of the real world. We learned that it is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning. We also learned that a random assortment of data cannot be considered a database. Later on, we learned that the whole exercise is called the database schema.
