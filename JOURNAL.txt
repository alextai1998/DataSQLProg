I’m finally back haha. I’ve missed the last two classes because I was really ill. Today I felt really overwhelmed because I didn’t know what to do or how much I’ve missed. It is slightly better now cuz I went to find Dr. Pinzon after school. I am planning to play around with the SQL workbench during the weekend!
