Today marks the last class of this Database Modeling course. This is a semester course and we went through the numerous steps and process of designing and generating a database. We started from drawing our ER diagrams to learning how to convert these ER diagrams into our relational schema. I think one of the most confusing part of the process is the normalization process. The concept of normalization is easy to grasp (reducing anomalies) but the actual doing of this process was a little challenging. After spending a great deal of time on normalization we started for the first time with SQL. I was a little sick during the first two classes when we started using DataGrip and mySQL Workbench, so I did not really know these two applications work with each other. From setting up databases, using databases, creating tables all the way to inserting data into these tables, we spent a short amount of time learning the basics of constructing our designs into actual databases. The much more challenging yet interesting part came next -- queries. The queries are are split between simple and complex queries. Simple queries are queries that utilize simple commands and specifies such as ORDER BY, SELECT, LIMIT, and UNION. While complex queries including INNER JOIN and GROUP BY. This course has been very interesting, as I have never taken a course like this. Iâ€™m not even sure if this course falls under math, computer science, or neither. Regarding the use of this course in my future career, since I am a business student, I mainly took this course out of interest. However, possible fields that I might get into in the future just so happens to be MIS management information systems, and I believe that the knowledge and experience that I gained from this course would be extremely valuable to me if that happens.
